# Week 2 updates

+ Outline of the video
  + **Part 1**: from raw audio to intensities.
    + Introduce the theoretical (continuous) theorems of Fourier transform.
    + (Main part) Then give the discrete theorems (DFT, FFT, STFT) enable us to solve real world problems.
  + **Part 2**: build graphical effects for the obtaining frequencies.
    + Aim: show the beauty of maths & music. (the second task of the video)
    - [x] experiment with the effects of graphs
      + summer_project_1.ggb
      + Thoughts: add the pitches at a time directly but in two dimensions (x and y), along with some scaling, i.e. in the ggb file, cureve C2 is for two pitches at a time, C3 for three at a  time. Single pitches may be treated seperatly (curve S1). Then smooth transitions between the notes would be the animations of the graphs.
+ Literature review 
  
  + chords recognition (with Hidden Markov Model, expectation maximization) is seperated from Fourier transform, may be less important
  + The convergence theorem and lemmas in the second paper (pure maths paper) may be less important
  - [x] Look at DFT, FFT and STFT 
  - [ ] experiment with the given example implementation in the paper
- [x] Learning the code 
  + AlmostFourierTransform.py and its video, move the spikes as time/audio progress.
